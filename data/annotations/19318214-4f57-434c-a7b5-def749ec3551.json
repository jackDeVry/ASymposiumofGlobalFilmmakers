You know, I started out by just, you know, getting a camera and learning how to take pictures and learning how to print pictures, and learning how to build a dark room and learning how to do all the technical things and so on and so on. And then finally, trying to find out how you could sell pictures and become a, you know, would it be possible to be a professional photographer? And it was a case of over a period of, say, from the age of 13 to 17, you might say, going through step by step, by myself, without anybody really helping me the problem solving of becoming a photographer.

I mean assuming that they care, and you know, a lot of people that appear to care or may actually care, are still not going about things particularly the right way. When you think about it, I generally find that it's just that they don't have a good generalized approach to problem solving. They're not thorough, they don't consider all the possibilities. They don't prepare themselves with the right information, and so forth. So I think that photography, though it seemed like a hobby, but and ultimately led to a professional job in photography might have been more valuable than, you know, doing the proper things in school."

Now, what had happened is that I could not get into college, and all sorts of things. My father, who was an alumni of NYU uptown, took me to see the dean, you know, and said, you know, this is my son, and I was a student here in so fun, and nothing worked. So I started going to City College at night, under the hope that if I got a B average for so many credits, I don't remember now, that I could then get into day school, a day college. But within about, I don't know, a few weeks of this, I was down at look with some other pictures. And there was an extremely nice picture editor then, whose name was Helen O'Brien, and the managing editor at the time was Jack Gunther, who was then later killed in the Bryce Canyon, Utah plane crash."

And also getting out of school, I can't remember what was the the particular turning point, but being out of school, I began to read, and within a relatively short period of time, I would imagine, caught up with where I probably should have been had I had a modicum of interest in things in high school. Because, I mean, after all, you really only miss. I mean, before you're 12 or 13, how many, how many serious books can you read? So I only really blew four years of part time reading. How much time you go to school? All day you play? Is there any magic? Got to do your homework? So in retrospect, I don't feel that I missed reading that many books. And I felt that I I caught up pretty quickly when I became interested in in things in general."

Well, anyway, I finally sold the film to RKO Pathé, who are no longer in business either, and sold it for about $100 less than it cost me to make it. I know it was a small loss, but I had the pleasure of seeing it shown. And, you know, I remember I went to the Paramount Theater where it was playing with some Ava Gardner Robert mission picture. And you know, it was very exciting to see it on the screen. And it got a nationwide, nationwide and worldwide distribution. And so I thought everybody liked it, and they thought it was good. And I thought that this would be I'd get millions of offers on which I got none to do anything. So I made another documentary, this time about a flying priest."
